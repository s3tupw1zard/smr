# s3tupw1zard's Magisk Repo
- This repository stores modules for [MMRL](https://github.com/DerGoogler/MMRL) and [MRepo](https://github.com/MRepoApp/MRepo.git).

I'm using this privately. Please be aware that Magisk modules may not always be up to date.
This is especially if I needed to add a module by hand using a link to a zip file and if there is no updater.json or similar present from the developer.

## USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK
I'm not responsible for any potential damage to your device.

## Add to MMRL or MRepo 

```

## Add to MMRL-CLI
