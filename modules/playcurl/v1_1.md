### It was reported on the Official Pif group, people that are using a custom kernel are not passing device integrity anymore. Pif is not working for them since 25/01/24

+ **Solution is only change kernel**

+ **Confirmed Custom Rom running on LOS trips device integrity. Tried to use another custom kernel and it passes the device integrity**
  
+ **This is happening only for some people, not all!**
+ AS FOR NOW :
+ some pixel stock kernels
+ some sultan kernels
+ some lineage os kernels
+ The fp is valid

+ **Update : v15.4 fixed this issue and it should pass device integrity**
